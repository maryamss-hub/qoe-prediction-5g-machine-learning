# Personalized QoE Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for 5G Video Streaming

## Overview

This project presents a **demographic-aware Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction framework** for video streaming in 5G networks using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

The system improves prediction accuracy by augmenting datasets with synthetic demographic profiles and applying advanced models including **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Attention-based Neural Networks, and TabNet**.

The framework enables more realistic and personalized QoE prediction for modern video streaming systems.
